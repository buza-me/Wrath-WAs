Delays your casts by temporarily freezing your game to prevent early channeled spell and DOT clips.
Configurable in Custom Options.
Requires calibration for your computer, if you are using an old WOTLK and/or TBC client, not a recent classic client.
Negative world ping offset is more cast delay.
Positive world ping offset is less cast delay.
Absolute Offset does nothing unless Use World Ping Offset is disabled.
For example 40ms world ping and -10 offset is same as an Absolute Offset of 30.

Only test your settings while inside an instance, because the game ticks much slower when outside of an instance.

Use /run SQToggle() to toggle spell queue enabled on and off.
Use /run SQCalibrate() to calibrate the freeze duration for your computer.
Calibrate every time you enter a raid and when your processor speed changes, like a battery saver mode or overclock.

To use spell queue include on top of your spell macro, below #showtooltip:
/run SQ(spell, unitID), where unitID is optional.
Unit id can be anything like "target" or "focus" or "pettarget" etc.

Mind Flay example with spell name (auto max rank):
#showtooltip
/run SQ("Mind Flay")
/cast Mind Flay

Mind Flay example with spell name and specific rank:
#showtooltip
/run SQ("Mind Flay(Rank 9)")
/cast Mind Flay(Rank 9)

Mind Flay example with spell ID:
#showtooltip
/run SQ(48156)
/cast Mind Flay(Rank 9)

Devouring Plague example with spell name and focus as a tracked unit:
#showtooltip
/run SQ("Devouring Plague", "focus")
/cast [target=focus] Devouring Plague

Reports spell queue delay amounts (in milliseconds) via WeakAuras.ScanEvents("SOLTI_SPELL_QUEUE_DELAY", delay)
Reports spell queue max delay (ms) setting via WeakAuras.ScanEvents("SOLTI_SPELL_QUEUE_MAX_WAIT", val)
